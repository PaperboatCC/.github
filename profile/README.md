### The link manager that improves your web experience

---------

> **Shorten any link for free**
>
> URLs can often be long, especially when pointing to specific resources.
> Fasm.ga lets you save links in an easily rememberable format.

> **Start monetizing quickly**
>
> You don't need to set up adware on your webpage. Earn money by using our
> monetization tools. Fasm.ga gives you the option to add a nonâ€“distruptive
> middleware between the redirect page and your link, and show quick and
> privacy respectful ads to the user. (Users can skip this process.)

> **Optimized for sharing**
>
> You can easily edit or remove the custom link preview from your
> shortened URLs.
